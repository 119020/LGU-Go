      "intro": "Life is like Go, no regrets. Go, this ancient game with a history of thousands of years, still thrives with vitality in today's modern world. What does Go bring to our lives? In the wave of artificial intelligence, where is Go headed? Several members of the YiQiu Go Club will share with us the club's development stories and their experiences in learning Go, exploring the future of Go in the AI era.",

        "title": "Discovering YiQiu: Cultural Promotion Through Go",
        "q1": "Q: The name 'YiQiu' is very poetic. What is its special meaning?",
        "a1": "A: The name 'YiQiu' comes from 'Mencius·Gaozi I'. In ancient times, Go was called 'Yi', and during the Warring States period, a man named 'Qiu' was known as 'YiQiu' because of his skill in Go. The club is named 'YiQiu' to symbolize the wisdom and depth of Go, as represented by the ancient master YiQiu. We aim to build a platform for Go enthusiasts on campus and to promote Go culture, attracting more students and faculty who are interested in the game.",
        "q2": "Q: Do you regularly organize activities or competitions? How are these events received?",
        "a2": "A1: Every Friday evening, we hold regular Go activities in the campus activity room, welcoming all interested students. In addition, the 'Go King Championship' in the fall semester is our flagship event, mainly for freshmen and some senior members. The atmosphere at the event is very lively, and winners receive exquisite Go sets. In the spring semester, we offer public teaching classes, which are well-received by students and faculty.",
        "a3": "A2: Since the fall semester of 2019, we have collaborated with the Shenzhen MSU-BIT Go Club to organize inter-university Go exchange matches, promoting friendly exchanges between students from both universities.",
        "q3": "Q: Many student clubs participate in various competitions, which not only serve as a testament to the club's honor but also foster friendships among members. What are some of the YiQiu Go Club's proudest achievements in competitions?",
        "a4": "A: We participate in open Go tournaments and university-level Go competitions every year. For example, in the 2022 Shenzhen University League and the 2024 Greater Bay Area University League, the YiQiu Go Club won the championship with an undefeated record.",
        "a5": "From 2023 to 2024, the club has had members selected as representatives of the Shenzhen team for two consecutive years to participate in the 'Shizhou Cup' Hong Kong International University Tournament held at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. We also collaborated with the Chinese University of Hong Kong to form a team for the 'City of Youth' National University Invitational Tournament, achieving impressive results.",
        "a6": "At the same time, club members have achieved top-six placements in various Go competitions in Guangdong Province and Shenzhen City, defeating strong amateur players and even professional players.",
        "q4": "Q: As a platform for promoting Go culture, what efforts has the YiQiu Go Club made in spreading and popularizing Go?",
        "a7": "A: The public teaching classes we hold every year are part of these efforts, aiming to introduce more beginners to Go. Whether they are students with no prior experience or enthusiasts who want to delve deeper into Go culture, we provide a friendly learning environment. Our goal is to develop the YiQiu Go Club into a part of campus culture, allowing more people to experience the charm of Go through activities and competitions."

        "title": "The Path of Go: Starting with Interest, Sustained by Passion",
        "q1": "Q: Go is known as the jewel in the crown of intellectual sports. Its rules are simple, yet it is extremely complex. Many people have been exposed to Go in their childhood, but few persist. How did you manage to stick with it during your learning process?",
        "a1": "A1: The essence of Go is not to compete with others but with oneself. As long as you strive to do your best, winning or losing becomes less important.",
        "a2": "A2: The charm of Go lies not only in the game on the board, but also in the fact that it can be a way to spice up life. In tedious study and life, Go allows me to find a way to relax and exercise my concentration.",
        "q2": "Q: Go requires long-term concentration and patience. A single game usually takes two hours. For young people accustomed to a fast-paced life, such focus and 'endurance of solitude' are not easy. How do you manage it?",
        "a3": "A1: I believe the ability to focus comes from a genuine love for Go. Every time I play, I immerse myself in the world of the game. During a match, my eyes are only on the board, and my mind is focused on the possibilities of each move.",
        "a4": "A2: For me, it is a way to converse with myself. On the board, you can feel your mind at work and see the changes in the overall situation through step-by-step deduction. This process is very rewarding. Moreover, Go is a 'silent communication'. Every time I play against an opponent, I can sense their personality and way of thinking. This silent interaction makes me enjoy the process even more.",
        "a5": "A3: Whenever I play a wonderful game, the sense of accomplishment makes me forget all my fatigue. I have gradually learned to treat Go as a form of 'cultivation'. Every move on the board is like a choice in life. Even when the situation seems unfavorable, I adjust my mindset and find opportunities to break through."

    "title": "Go and AI: Breaking Traditions, Rebirth of Art",
    "q1": "Q: The matches between AlphaGo and Lee Sedol and Ke Jie sparked a Go craze, even attracting attention from outside the Go community. As Go enthusiasts, how do you view the impact of artificial intelligence on Go?",
    "a1": "A1: Those matches truly shook the Go world. The emergence of AlphaGo not only made professional players realize the gap in computational power between humans and AI but also had a profound impact on Go culture itself. In the past, we always believed that Go was the ultimate expression of human wisdom, but AlphaGo showed us that the possibilities on the board are far more complex and unpredictable than we imagined. To some extent, AI has pushed the development of Go. Professional players improve their strategies by studying AI's game records, while amateur players use AI to learn about opening and mid-game tactics. This is a technological revolution, but it has not replaced the cultural value of Go. Instead, it has made us more aware of the infinite possibilities of Go.",
    "a2": "A2: AI has indeed changed the way we learn Go. In the past, players mainly relied on the master-disciple system, accumulating experience through human-to-human matches. The advent of AI has broken this limitation. Nowadays, it is common for professional players to train and play against AI. For example, world champion Ding Hao mentioned in an interview that he played over 6,000 games against AI during his preparation. Such high-intensity training is almost impossible between human players. For us amateurs, AI is like a tireless teacher. Through AI analysis, we can quickly identify our weaknesses, especially in the opening phase, where AI provides near-perfect suggestions to help us improve.",
    "q2": "Q: It is a fact that AI has had a huge impact on Go. Some believe that AI's involvement may diminish the artistic value of Go and even render traditional human-to-human matches meaningless. What do you think?",
    "a3": "A1: On one hand, AI has indeed shown us the 'truth' of Go, but on the other hand, it has also made human players' mistakes more apparent and even subject to ridicule. For example, AI uses win rate fluctuation curves to display changes in the game in real-time, allowing even non-Go players to see a player's mistakes. Some might think this diminishes the artistry of the game. However, from my perspective, AI has not taken away the charm of Go but has helped us re-examine it. AI can produce moves that were previously unimaginable and eliminate suboptimal strategies. At the same time, it evolves at an incredible speed, bringing humans closer to the essence of Go.",
    "a4": "A2: The charm of Go has never been solely about winning or losing but about its test of human wisdom and emotions. Even with AI's assistance, human-to-human matches remain irreplaceable. The process of playing Go is not just a battle of logic but also a deep form of communication between people. This kind of communication cannot be replaced by AI, as it embodies a human touch.",
    "q3": "Q: As a traditional culture, do you think the cultural value of Go will change as it integrates with AI?",
    "a5": "A1: I think this needs to be viewed from two perspectives. On one hand, Go, as a traditional culture, is rooted in humanity's exploration and understanding of the game. This part will not disappear with the involvement of AI. On the contrary, AI has accelerated the evolution of Go culture, helping us quickly eliminate misconceptions and providing new directions for further exploration. However, on the other hand, AI's cold, calculated logic has indeed taken away some of the 'human touch' of Go. To AI, a game is merely a process of data optimization; it does not care about the beauty of the game or the psychological state of human players. I believe that human players remain the core of Go culture, and AI is just a tool. It's like calligraphers using computers for design, but the true art of calligraphy still requires human effort.",
    "a6": "A2: AI is not only a driver of Go but also a new cultural symbol. Its involvement has made Go more modern and attracted more young people to the game. In the past, Go had a high barrier to entry, with significant gaps in understanding and judgment between players of different levels, which objectively hindered its promotion. In the AI era, this gap has been reduced, and with the rise of live streaming, Go has become more accessible. This kind of inheritance and promotion does not weaken the traditional essence of Go but allows more people to discover its depth and elegance.",
    "q4": "Q: In the 'post-AI era' of Go, how big is the gap between human players and AI? What changes will the traditional form of human-to-human matches undergo?",
    "a7": "A1: Technically speaking, it is almost impossible for humans to defeat top-tier AI. The strongest Go AIs, such as KataGo and FineArt, can simulate calculations and strategies beyond human capabilities. Top world champions are about 2-3 stones weaker than the strongest AI. However, I do not believe this renders human-to-human matches meaningless. On the contrary, human matches remain the core of Go, as they carry emotions, wisdom, and humanized thinking—things that AI can never replace.",
    "a8": "A2: AI's existence has made Go more like an 'art in competition'. It provides humans with a new perspective, but it cannot understand the emotions and stories behind the game. I believe that future human-to-human matches will focus more on cultural and artistic expression rather than just winning or losing.",
    "a9": "A3: In the future, AI may play a greater role in Go education and competitions, but it cannot completely replace traditional human matches. Go is not just a game; it is a form of communication and connection between people. This kind of communication sets Go apart from other intellectual games, making it an important carrier of cultural heritage and a continuation of human emotions."
