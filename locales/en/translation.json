      "intro": "Life is like Go, no regrets. Go, this ancient game with a history of thousands of years, still thrives with vitality in today's modern world. What does Go bring to our lives? In the wave of artificial intelligence, where is Go headed? Several members of the YiQiu Go Club will share with us the club's development stories and their experiences in learning Go, exploring the future of Go in the AI era.",

        "title": "Discovering YiQiu: Cultural Promotion Through Go",
        "q1": "Q: The name 'YiQiu' is very poetic. What is its special meaning?",
        "a1": "A: The name 'YiQiu' comes from 'Mencius·Gaozi I'. In ancient times, Go was called 'Yi', and during the Warring States period, a man named 'Qiu' was known as 'YiQiu' because of his skill in Go. The club is named 'YiQiu' to symbolize the wisdom and depth of Go, as represented by the ancient master YiQiu. We aim to build a platform for Go enthusiasts on campus and to promote Go culture, attracting more students and faculty who are interested in the game.",
        "q2": "Q: Do you regularly organize activities or competitions? How are these events received?",
        "a2": "A1: Every Friday evening, we hold regular Go activities in the campus activity room, welcoming all interested students. In addition, the 'Go King Championship' in the fall semester is our flagship event, mainly for freshmen and some senior members. The atmosphere at the event is very lively, and winners receive exquisite Go sets. In the spring semester, we offer public teaching classes, which are well-received by students and faculty.",
        "a3": "A2: Since the fall semester of 2019, we have collaborated with the Shenzhen MSU-BIT Go Club to organize inter-university Go exchange matches, promoting friendly exchanges between students from both universities.",
        "q3": "Q: Many student clubs participate in various competitions, which not only serve as a testament to the club's honor but also foster friendships among members. What are some of the YiQiu Go Club's proudest achievements in competitions?",
        "a4": "A: We participate in open Go tournaments and university-level Go competitions every year. For example, in the 2022 Shenzhen University League and the 2024 Greater Bay Area University League, the YiQiu Go Club won the championship with an undefeated record.",
        "a5": "From 2023 to 2024, the club has had members selected as representatives of the Shenzhen team for two consecutive years to participate in the 'Shizhou Cup' Hong Kong International University Tournament held at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. We also collaborated with the Chinese University of Hong Kong to form a team for the 'City of Youth' National University Invitational Tournament, achieving impressive results.",
        "a6": "At the same time, club members have achieved top-six placements in various Go competitions in Guangdong Province and Shenzhen City, defeating strong amateur players and even professional players.",
        "q4": "Q: As a platform for promoting Go culture, what efforts has the YiQiu Go Club made in spreading and popularizing Go?",
        "a7": "A: The public teaching classes we hold every year are part of these efforts, aiming to introduce more beginners to Go. Whether they are students with no prior experience or enthusiasts who want to delve deeper into Go culture, we provide a friendly learning environment. Our goal is to develop the YiQiu Go Club into a part of campus culture, allowing more people to experience the charm of Go through activities and competitions."

        "title": "The Path of Go: Starting with Interest, Sustained by Passion",
        "q1": "Q: Go is known as the jewel in the crown of intellectual sports. Its rules are simple, yet it is extremely complex. Many people have been exposed to Go in their childhood, but few persist. How did you manage to stick with it during your learning process?",
        "a1": "A1: The essence of Go is not to compete with others but with oneself. As long as you strive to do your best, winning or losing becomes less important.",
        "a2": "A2: The charm of Go lies not only in the game on the board, but also in the fact that it can be a way to spice up life. In tedious study and life, Go allows me to find a way to relax and exercise my concentration.",
        "q2": "Q: Go requires long-term concentration and patience. A single game usually takes two hours. For young people accustomed to a fast-paced life, such focus and 'endurance of solitude' are not easy. How do you manage it?",
        "a3": "A1: I believe the ability to focus comes from a genuine love for Go. Every time I play, I immerse myself in the world of the game. During a match, my eyes are only on the board, and my mind is focused on the possibilities of each move.",
        "a4": "A2: For me, it is a way to converse with myself. On the board, you can feel your mind at work and see the changes in the overall situation through step-by-step deduction. This process is very rewarding. Moreover, Go is a 'silent communication'. Every time I play against an opponent, I can sense their personality and way of thinking. This silent interaction makes me enjoy the process even more.",
        "a5": "A3: Whenever I play a wonderful game, the sense of accomplishment makes me forget all my fatigue. I have gradually learned to treat Go as a form of 'cultivation'. Every move on the board is like a choice in life. Even when the situation seems unfavorable, I adjust my mindset and find opportunities to break through."

      "ai": {
        "title": "AI game-play: breaking through tradition, a new art form",
        "q1": "Q: The match between AlphaGo and Lee Sedol and Ke Jie has set off a Go craze and even attracted the attention of many people outside the circle. As Go enthusiasts, how do you view the impact of artificial intelligence on Go?",
        "a1": "A1: That game really shocked the entire Go world. The emergence of AlphaGo not only made professional players realize the gap between humans and artificial intelligence in computing power, but also had an impact on the Go culture itself. In the past, we always thought that Go was the ultimate embodiment of human wisdom, but AlphaGo made us realize that the possibilities on the board are far more complex and unpredictable than we imagined. To some extent, the intervention of AI has promoted the development of Go. Professional players improve their thinking by studying AI's chess records, and amateur players use AI to learn layout and mid-game battles. This is a technological innovation, but it has not replaced the cultural value of Go. Instead, it has made us more clearly aware of the infinite possibilities of Go.",
        "a2": "A2: Artificial intelligence has indeed changed the way of learning Go. In the past, players mainly relied on the master-apprentice system to accumulate experience through games between humans, but the emergence of AI has broken this limitation. Nowadays, it has become the norm for professional players to play and train with AI. World champion Ding Hao once mentioned in an interview that he played more than 6,000 games with AI in preparation. This high-intensity training is almost impossible for human players to achieve. For us amateurs, AI is more like a tireless teacher. Through AI analysis, we can quickly discover our own problems, especially in the layout stage, AI can give near-perfect suggestions to help us improve our chess skills.",
        "q2": "Q: It is a fact that AI has a huge impact on Go. Some people believe that the addition of AI may weaken the artistry of Go and even make the traditional 'human game' meaningless. What do you think?",
        "a3": "A1: On the one hand, AI does allow us to see the 'truth' of Go, but on the other hand, it also makes the mistakes of human players more obvious, and even easy to be 'ridiculed'. For example, AI will use the win rate fluctuation curve to display the changes in the situation in real time, so that people who don't understand Go can also intuitively see the mistakes of a certain player. Some people may think that this weakens the artistry of the game process. But from my point of view, AI has not made Go lose its charm, but helped us to re-examine Go. It will play some moves that were unimaginable in the past, and will also eliminate some non-optimal ideas. At the same time, it also has an extremely high rate of improvement. It brings humans closer to the essence of Go.",
        "a4": "A2: The charm of Go is not just about winning or losing, but about the test it puts on human wisdom and emotions. Even with the help of AI, the game between humans still has irreplaceable significance. The process of playing Go is not only a competition of logic, but also a deep communication between people. This kind of communication cannot be replaced by AI, and it reflects the human side.",
        "q3": "Q: Do you think that the cultural value of Go, as a traditional culture, will change in the process of combining with artificial intelligence?",
        "a5": "A1: I think this needs to be viewed from two aspects. On the one hand, as a traditional culture, Go is rooted in human exploration and understanding of the way of Go, and this part will not disappear with the addition of AI. On the contrary, AI has accelerated the evolution of Go culture. It allows us to eliminate wrong ideas more quickly, and at the same time provides new directions for further exploration of the way of Go. But on the other hand, AI's cold calculation logic does make Go lose some of its 'human touch'. In the eyes of AI, the game is a process of data optimization. It does not care about the beauty of the game or the psychological state of human players. I believe that human players are still the core of Go culture, and AI is just an auxiliary tool. Just as calligraphers use computer-aided design, the real art of calligraphy still needs humans to complete it.",
        "a6": "A2: AI is not only a promoter of Go, but also a new cultural symbol. Its addition makes Go more modern and attracts more young people to join the sport. In the past, the threshold for Go was high, and the gap between the understanding and judgment of the game between different levels was too large, which was objectively not conducive to its dissemination and promotion. In the AI ​​era, this gap has been alleviated, and at the same time, catching up with the trend of the live broadcast industry, it can be said that Go has also been 'popularized', and this inheritance and promotion will not only not weaken the traditional connotation of Go, but will allow more people to discover the depth and elegance of Go.",
        "q4": "Q: In the post-AI era of Go, how big is the gap between human players and AI? Will there be any changes in the traditional form of human-to-human Go?",
        "a7": "A1: From a technical perspective, it is almost impossible for humans to defeat top AI. The strongest Go AIs at present, such as KataGo and Fine Art, are able to simulate calculations and strategies that exceed human capabilities. The world champion-level top players are 2-3 points behind the strongest AI. But I don't think this will make human games meaningless. On the contrary, games between humans have always been the core of Go, because it carries emotions, wisdom and humanistic thinking, which AI can never replace.",
        "a8": "A2: The existence of AI makes Go more like an 'art in competition'. It provides humans with a new perspective, but it cannot understand the emotions and stories behind the game. I think that in the future, human Go games will pay more attention to cultural and artistic expression, rather than just pursuing victory or defeat.",
        "a9": "A3: In the future, AI may be more involved in Go education and competitions, but it cannot completely replace the traditional form of Go. Playing Go is not only a game, but also a form of communication and connection between people. This kind of communication makes Go different from other intellectual games. It is an important carrier of cultural heritage and a continuation of human emotions."

        "title": "Final Thoughts",
        "content": "On the chessboard, black and white pieces are arranged in a crisscross pattern, and every move is carefully planned; outside the chessboard, there are laughter and friendship. The members of the Go team of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) showed us the ingenuity and exquisiteness of the chess game, the perseverance and responsibility of the players, and the profoundness and depth of the way of Go. They are based on the times, and see the rebirth of Go in the collision between AI and Go, and see that human wisdom is still shining in the interweaving of modern technology and traditional Go.\n\nThe Go Team of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) uses the campus chess organization Yi Qiu Chess Club as a platform to let the chess culture shine on campus and build a platform for more like-minded chess enthusiasts to communicate, exchange ideas and make progress together.\n\nGo is like life. When a piece is placed, countless possibilities for the future are built in a small space."
